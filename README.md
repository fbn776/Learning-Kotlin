# Learning Kotlin

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello World!!")
}
```

I'm learning Kotlin and this repo has some things I learned.
This repo has Notes, Code and other things that were a bit hard at first, but later interesting for me when I learned Kotlin.

### Notes
`notes/NOTES.md` has some important notes. These are notes I prepared while I was studying Kotlin. There isn't much there, but the ones present are important!
See [Notes](notes/NOTES.md) to take a look.

### Resource I used
* [The official Kotlin Docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
* [Kotlin tutorial by freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9UC9DY-vIU&t=2746s)
* [Android developers](https://developer.android.com/kotlin)
* [Free udacity course on Kotlin](https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud9011)
* [w3Schools Kotlin](https://www.w3schools.com/KOTLIN/index.php)


I hope someone finds this useful.
